IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN Claim: *'This species is likely to be disadvantaged by the current regime of frequent and extensive fire (Corbett et al. 2003, Woinarski et al. 2010), predation by feral cats (Woinarski et al. 2011) and some loss of its extensive habitat.''*

### Studies in support

A single antechinus was among small mammals negatively correlated with cat occupancy (Stobo-Wilson et al. 2020a).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between cats and antechinus populations. A single animal is not population data.
