IUCN status: **Extinct**

IUCN claim: *"The extinction of the Pig-footed Bandicoot is attributed to predation by feral cats and red foxes."*

### Studies in support

Southern pig-footed bandicoots were last confirmed at Alice Springs, the Western Division of NSW, and Youndegin 21-31, 0-50 and 48-58 after cats arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Southern pig-footed bandicoots were last confirmed in the Murray-Darling and south-west Australia 24 and 50 years before, to 17 and 19 years after, cats arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

No studies were found evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of southern pig-footed bandicoots. In two regions it cannot be verified that extirpation occurred after cat arrival.
