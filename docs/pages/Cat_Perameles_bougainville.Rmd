IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN claim: *"The current major threats to the natural subpopulations of the species include: the accidental introduction of predators (introduced cats and foxes)"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Short (2016) described that the incursion of cats into a fenced reserve led to the loss of the entire group of semi-captive, predator-inexperienced bandicoots, but no data was provided. Richards (2012) described that the incursion of cats into a fenced reserve led to population decline, which recovered once cats were killed, but no data was provided. Bandicoots were last confirmed in the Nullarbor, WA and SA 44-68 years after cats arrived (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Bandicoots were reintroduced successfully into a fenced reserve with cats (defined as low density) and no evidence of predation was recorded (Richards & Short 2003). Bandicoots were last confirmed in NSW 18 years before cats arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between cats and western barred bandicoot populations. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations. In contradiction with the claim, two extirpation records pre-date the fox arrival records.

![**Evidence linking *Perameles bougainville* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Perameles bougainville* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Perameles bougainville*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Perameles bougainville.png)
