The Desert Rat-kangaroo was discovered in the early 1840s and described by John Gould in 1843, on the basis of three specimens sent to him by George Grey, the governor of South Australia at the time, from an unknown locality in that State. After a long period (almost 90 years) with no records, the animal was rediscovered by pastoralist Mr L. Reese of Appamunna Station in 1931. Mammalogist Hedley Finlayson visited the site of Reese’s rediscovery in December 1931 and spent a week with six horsemen riding over an area of ‘about 20 square miles’ seeing 17 Desert Rat-kangaroos and catching 12 specimens (Finlayson 1932a, b, 1935; Robinson and Forest 2013).</p>    <p>More recent information suggests it occurred as far east as Galway Downs, north to Windorah, and west to the northern extremity of Lake Eyre.

Predation by feral cats (severe, possibly catastrophic in combination with other threats): the Broad-faced Potoroo became extinct before the arrival of the Red Fox in Western Australia; however, Cats were present throughout the range of this species by the 1890s (Abbott 2002, 2008); there is abundant evidence that feral Cats have a significant effect on medium-sized Australian mammals, including causing extinction (Dickman 1996)<br/>2. Exotic disease (severe, possibly catastrophic in combination with other threats): evidence for epizootic disease as the primary factor, but probably interacting with drought and predation by feral Cats as secondary   factors, in decline and extinction of many mammal species in Western Australia; many of these declined before the arrival of Red Foxes; however, only parts of range would have been affected (Abbott 2006)<br/>3. Inappropriate fire regimes (severe): fire regimes changed dramatically after European settlement; Aborigines used fire extensively and frequently to produce a mosaic of different-aged vegetation (Gammage 2011); this may have benefited this species<br/>4. Habitat degradation and resource depletion due to livestock and feral herbivores (severe): sheep grazing was widespread in parts of the Western Australian wheatbelt before clearing; however, it was limited to areas where there were no <em>Gastrolobium</em> spp., the grazing of which caused death in stock<br/>5. Habitat loss and fragmentation (moderate but only over small area of range): extinction occurred before widespread land clearing for agriculture in the Western Australia wheatbelt","<p>Most of the early accounts of the Broad-faced Potoroo note that it was a rare species, and this is consistent with the small number of specimens, compared with other species obtained by Masters in the 1860s in southern Western Australia (Glauert 1950; see also Ride 1970). This is also consistent with the very small numbers of specimens held in modern mammal collections in museums. Its remains are not abundant in most cave deposits, with the single exception of a small cave at the western end of the Baxter Cliffs, Nullarbor Plain, where Masked Owls <em>Tyto novaehollandiae</em> may have been responsible for the accumulation (A. Baynes <em>pers. comm</em>.).</p>","<p>Specimens and subfossil remains indicate that the Broad-faced Potoroo occurred on the northern Swan Coastal Plain, in the wheatbelt and along the south coast of Western Australia as far east as the Great Australian Bight, on the Eyre and Yorke Peninsulas in south-eastern South Australia and on Kangaroo Island, South Australia (Baynes 1987, McDowell <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>",Globally extinct,pop_146,,1e+05,1912.5,1917.5,1917.29740680713,0.986660913354026,1865,1885,1876.4262560778,9.39266903372917

Despite numerous, including contemporary, reports of its existence, and several organised searches (e.g. Smith 1980; see SEWPaC 2012), there has been no irrefutable evidence of its survival.","There was extensive persecution of the Thylacine because of perceived threat to sheep and fear of a large predator (Mooney and Rounsevell 2008); in latter years collecting by museums and zoos was a major reason for hunting; single-species ‘population viability analysis’ models are unable to account for the Thylacine’s demise unless a high human harvest, small starting population size or low maximum population growth rate was assumed, even if disease effects were included from 1906 to 1909, however, the Thylacine's demise is readily recreated using the disease-free multi-species metamodels that simulated declines in native prey populations (particularly due to competition with introduced sheep) (Prowse <em>et al</em>. 2013).",This species is presumed to be extinct.,"<p>The Thylacine was once found in New Guinea and was widespread on the Australian mainland, but disappeared from the latter by at least 2000 years ago, probably because of predation by and competition from the Dingo <em>Canis lupus</em> (Johnson 2006). In modern times it was known only from Tasmania, which was isolated from the Australian mainland c. 8000 – 10&#160;000 years ago, before the arrival of the Dingo on the mainland. It was widespread in Tasmania, but most abundant in open forest and woodland (Guiler 1985; Paddle 2000). It occurred in most habitat types from low (east) to high (north-west) rainfall but at low densities in the south-west where rainfall is very high, soil fertility is very low, and vegetation is hummock grassland (button grass), wet scrub, or wet forest.</p>",Globally extinct,pop_166,,State boundary,,,,,1815,1885,1868.92904953146,20.4247672704276

The primary cause of decline was probably predation by feral cats, but resource depletion and habitat change due to clearing, livestock, changed fire regimes and rabbits may have contributed to the decline in some areas (Woinarski <em>et al. </em>2014).","This species is presumed to be extinct.
