### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Southern pig-footed bandicoots were last confirmed in the Murray-Darling, Alice Springs, Western Division of NSW, Youndegin, and southwest Australia 49-23, 19-14, 30-5, 32-27, and 95-61 years before foxes arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and the extinction of southern pig-footed bandicoots. All five bandicoot extirpation records pre-date fox arrival records.
