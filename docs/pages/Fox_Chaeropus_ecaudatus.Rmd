### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Southern pig-footed bandicoots were last confirmed in the NT, NSW and WA 17-86 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and the extinction of southern pig-footed bandicoots. In contradiction with the claim the extinction record pre-dates the fox arrival record.
