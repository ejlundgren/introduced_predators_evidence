IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN claim: *"Threats are poorly understood but include predation by and competition with feral cats and Red Foxes,"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Pedler et al. (2016) documented cat decline and mulgara increase in occurance and occupancy when rabbits declined. Mulgara were found in cat’s diet (Mahon 1999; Paltridge 2002; Paltridge 2005; Vernes et al. 2021). Mulgara were last confirmed in the Western Division of NSW and the Nullarbor 19-69 and 38-58 after cats arrived, respectively  (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

Negative correlation between cats and mulgara abundance was documented in one study. Causality for decline is uncertain due to confounding variables (e.g. rabbits).

![**Evidence linking *Dasycercus cristicauda* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasycercus cristicauda* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Dasycercus cristicauda*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show minimum and maximum extinction intervals. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Dasycercus cristicauda.png)
