IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN claim: *"Threats are poorly understood but include predation by and competition with feral cats and Red Foxes,"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Mulgara were found in catâ€™s diet (Mahon 1999; Paltridge 2002; Vernes et al. 2021b); and mulgara were last confirmed 24 and 43 years after cats arrived in NSW and the Nullarbor, respectively (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to mulgara populations.

![**Evidence linking *Dasycercus cristicauda* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasycercus cristicauda* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Dasycercus cristicauda*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Dasycercus cristicauda.png)
