IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN Claim: *Threats are poorly understood but include predation by and competition with feral cats and Red Foxes,'*

</center>

### Studies in support

Mulgara were found in cat’s diet (Mahon 1999; Paltridge 2002; Vernes et al. 2021b); and mulgara were last confirmed 24 and 43 years after cats arrived in NSW and the Nullarbor, respectively (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to mulgara populations.
