IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Very high/Extreme**

IUCN claim: *"The major threat to the Bilby is predation by introduced red foxes and feral cats"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Bilbies reintroduced inside fenced reserves (excluding foxes, cats and dingoes) have improved survival rates (Moseby et al. 2011). Cat predation was a regular cause of mortality for mostly predator-inexperienced reintroduced bilbies at two sites (Moseby et al. 2011; Lohr et al. 2021). Cats were documented hunting reintroduced bilbies in another study (Moseby et al. 2012) and hunting locally-born bilbies (Paltridge et al. 1997; Wysong 2016; Murphy et al. 2019). The last records of bilby populations are, on average, 58 years after cats arrived (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Cat probability of occurrence did not predict bilby occurrence (Southgate et al. 2007). Bilbies were successfully reintroduced into a fenced reserve where cats occurred (Richards 2012). Moseby et al. (2019) reported a positive correlation between cat and bilby abundance within a fenced reserve and bilby recruitment was confirmed despite evidence of cat predation. A cat breached the fence of a semi-captive bilby enclosure, none of which were hunted during one month (from Moseby et al. 2015). Cats and bilbies co-occurred for a century in one locale in Western Australia (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between  cats and bilby populations. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations. In contradiction with the claim, no negative association was found between the two species, which have co-occurred for a century in one locale.

![**Evidence linking *Macrotis lagotis* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Macrotis lagotis* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Macrotis lagotis*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008.
