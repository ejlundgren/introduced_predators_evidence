IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high/Extreme**

IUCN Claim: *'The major threat to the Bilby is predation by introduced red foxes and feral cats''*

### Studies in support

Bilbies reintroduced inside fenced reserves (excluding foxes, cats and dingoes) have improved survival rates (Moseby et al. 2011). Cat predation was a regular cause of mortality for mostly predator-inexperienced reintroduced bilbies at two sites (Moseby et al. 2011; Lohr et al. 2021). Cats were documented hunting reintroduced bilbies in another study (Moseby et al. 2012) and hunting locally-born bilbies (Paltridge et al. 1997; Wysong 2016; Murphy et al. 2019). The last record of bilby populations is, on average, 58 years after cats arrived, including one population that co-occurred for a century (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Cat probability of occurrence did not predict bilby occurrence (Southgate et al. 2007). Bilbies were successfully reintroduced into a fenced reserve where cats occur (Richards 2012). Moseby et al. (2019) reported a positive correlation between cat and bilby abundance within a fenced reserve, despite evidence of predation, and bilby recruitment was confirmed. A cat breached the fence of semi-captive bilby enclosure, none of which were hunted in 1 month (from Moseby et al. 2015).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between  cats and bilby populations. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations. In contradiction with the claim, no negative association was found between the two species, which have co-occured for a century in one locale.
