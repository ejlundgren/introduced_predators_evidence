IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: ****

IUCN claim: *"The species is threatened by introduced predators, the Red Fox and feral Cat especially"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Foxes hunted 3 of 30 reintroduced, predator-inexperienced wallabies (Hayward et al. 2012).

### Studies not in support

Wallabies were last confirmed in NSW 3 years before foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and nail-tail wallaby populations. In contradiction with the claim, the extirpation record pre-dates the fox arrival record.

![**Evidence linking *Onychogalea fraenata* to foxes.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Onychogalea fraenata* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of *Onychogalea fraenata*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Onychogalea fraenata.png)
