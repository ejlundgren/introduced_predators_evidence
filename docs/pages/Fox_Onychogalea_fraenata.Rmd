IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN Claim: *"The species is threatened by introduced predators, the Red Fox and feral Cat especially'"*

### Studies in support

Foxes hunted 3 of 30 reintroduced, predator-inexperienced wallabies (Hayward et al. 2012).

### Studies not in support

Wallabies were last confirmed in NSW 3 years before foxes arrived (Table S2).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and nail-tail wallaby populations. In contradiction with the claim, the extirpation record pre-dates the fox arrival record.

![Evidence linking *Onychogalea fraenata* to foxes. **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Onychogalea fraenata* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of *Onychogalea fraenata*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Onychogalea fraenata.png)
