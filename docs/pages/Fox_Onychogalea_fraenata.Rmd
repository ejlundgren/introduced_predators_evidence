IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN Claim: *'The species is threatened by introduced predators, the Red Fox and feral Cat especially''*

</center>

### Studies in support

Foxes hunted 3 of 30 reintroduced, predator-inexperienced wallabies (Hayward et al. 2012).

### Studies not in support

Wallabies were last confirmed in NSW 3 years before foxes arrived (Table S2).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and nail-tail wallaby populations. In contradiction with the claim, the extirpation record pre-dates the fox arrival record.
