IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **High/Very High**

IUCN Claim: *'Predation by feral cats may also be a threat.''*

</center>

### Studies in support

Rock rats among small mammals negatively correlated with cat occupancy (Stobo-Wilson et al. 2020a).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

Cats have been documented among a range of ecological variables negatively correlated with Arnhem Land rock rats. Causality cannot be inferred due to confounding variables.

![**Fig. 1**  Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Zyzomys maini* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of Zyzomys maini, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Zyzomys maini.png)
