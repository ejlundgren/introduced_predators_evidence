IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **N/A**

IUCN Claim: *'Predation by feral cats is considered to be a severe threat over the species' entire range, but has not been quantified. Predation by the Red Fox is considered a minor threat because of the arboreal behaviour of phascogales.''*

</center>

### Studies in support

Friend et al. (1996) reported a positive correlation between poison-baiting and phascogale abundance.

### Studies not in support

Phascogales were last confirmed in NSW 46 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between foxes and red-tailed phascogale populations. Poison baiting is not a reliable proxy for fox abundance. In contradiction with the claim the extipration record pre-dates the fox arrival record.
