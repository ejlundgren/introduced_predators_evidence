IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Not assessed**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by feral cats is also occurring."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats hunt rock-wallabies (Paltridge et al. 1997; Read et al. 2018).

### Studies not in support

Cat prey preference for rock-wallabies was relatively low (Read et al. 2018).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to black-footed rock-wallaby population trends.

![**Evidence linking *Petrogale lateralis* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Petrogale lateralis* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Petrogale lateralis, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Petrogale lateralis.png)
