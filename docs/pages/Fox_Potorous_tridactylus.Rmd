IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN claim: *"The major threat is predation, especially by the invasive Red Fox but also by wild dogs and feral cats. "*

### Studies in support

Foxes hunt potoroos (Lunney et al. 1990; Long 2001; Glen & Dickman 2008; Claridge et al. 2010; Glen et al. 2011; Davis et al. 2015; Norton et al. 2015). Dexter & Murray (2009) reported that potoroo abundance increased about two years after intensification of poison-baiting in both treatment and control sites, but more steeply in the high intensity poisoning sites, but there was no difference in bait uptake between the treatment and control sites. Robley et al. (2014) reported that three measures of potoroo abundance tended to be higher at sites where poison-baiting was intensified compared to controls, corresponding with differences in bait uptake.

### Studies not in support

No association between fox and potoroo abundance was found between two adjacent sites (Norton et al. 2015). Long-nosed potoroo and fox occupancy were not correlated (Robley et al. 2022).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between foxes and long-nosed potoroo populations. Poison-baiting is not a reliable proxy for fox abundance.

![**Evidence linking *Potorous tridactylus* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Potorous tridactylus* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Potorous tridactylus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Potorous tridactylus.png)
