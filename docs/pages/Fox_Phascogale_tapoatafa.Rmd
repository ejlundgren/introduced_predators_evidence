IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Not assessed**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by the red fox is also a threat"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Phascogale remains were found in <1% of fox scats (Pascoe et al. 2012).

### Studies not in support

Phascogale persisted at low abundance as fox abundance increased, but no statistical analysis, control, or other variables were tested for (Wayne et al. 2017).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to brush-tailed phascogale populations.

![**Evidence linking *Phascogale tapoatafa* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Phascogale tapoatafa* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Phascogale tapoatafa, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Phascogale tapoatafa.png)
