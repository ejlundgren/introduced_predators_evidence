IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **N/A**

IUCN Claim: *Predation by the red fox is also a threat'*

</center>

### Studies in support

Phascogale remains were found in <1% of fox scats (Pascoe et al. 2012).

### Studies not in support

Phascogale persisted at low abundance as fox abundance increased, but no statistical analysis, control, or other variables were tested for (Wayne et al. 2017).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to brush-tailed phascogale populations.
