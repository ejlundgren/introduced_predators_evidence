### Studies in support

White-footed rabbit rats were last confirmed in Victoria 20 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

White-footed rabbit rats were last confirmed in NSW 29 years before cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of white-footed rabbit rats. In contradiction with the claim, the extinction record from NSW pre-dates the cat arrival record.
