IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN Claim: *The major threat is predation, especially by the invasive Red Fox but also by wild dogs and feral cats. '*

### Studies in support

Remains of potoroo were found in the cat’s diet (Schwarz 1995; Lazenby 2012). Cats hunt potoroos (Miritis et al. 2020).

### Studies not in support

Norton et al. (2015) reported that potoroos were more common at a site with cats, compared to a neighbouring site where no cats were detected. Miritis et al. (2020) reported that potoroos and abundant cats were positively correlated in space and in daily activity patterns and that cat presence did not affect potoroo detection probability.

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between cats and long-nosed potoroos. In contradiction with the claim, cats have been positively correlated with potoroos but causality cannot be determined due to confounding variables.
