IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN Claim: *The species presumably was extirpated from mainland Australia by a combination of predation by the Red Fox and feral cat and habitat disturbance.'*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats were the main cause of mortality of a reintroduced, predator-inexperienced, hare-wallaby group (Hardman et al. 2016). Hare-wallabies were last confirmed on the mainland in Western Australia 28-68 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between banded hare-wallabies and cats. The fate of reintroduced animals is is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations.
