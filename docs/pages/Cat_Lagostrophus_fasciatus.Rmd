IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN Claim: *'The species presumably was extirpated from mainland Australia by a combination of predation by the Red Fox and feral cat and habitat disturbance.''*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats were the main cause of mortality of a reintroduced, predator-inexperienced, hare-wallaby group (Hardman et al. 2016). Hare-wallabies were last confirmed on the mainland in Western Australia 28-68 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between banded hare-wallabies and cats. The fate of reintroduced animals is is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations.

![**Fig. 1** Evidence linking *Lagostrophus fasciatus* to cats. *A.* Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Lagostrophus fasciatus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of threatened mammals, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. *B.* Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats . Error bars show record uncertainty range. Small points show unconfirmed records (excluded from analyses). Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008 *Conservation Science Western Australia*](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Lagostrophus fasciatus.png)
