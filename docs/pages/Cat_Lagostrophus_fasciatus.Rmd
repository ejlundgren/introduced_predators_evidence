IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN claim: *"The species presumably was extirpated from mainland Australia by a combination ofÂ predation by the Red Fox and feral cat and habitat disturbance."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats were the main cause of mortality of a reintroduced, predator-inexperienced, hare-wallaby group (Hardman et al. 2016). Hare-wallabies were last confirmed on the mainland in Western Australia 28-68 years after cats arrived (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between banded hare-wallabies and cats. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations. The two species co-occurred for over half a century in one locale.

![**Evidence linking *Lagostrophus fasciatus* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Lagostrophus fasciatus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Lagostrophus fasciatus*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Lagostrophus fasciatus.png)
