IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN Claim: *'On the mainland, predation by introduced feral Cat and Red Foxes was the major cause of extinction in the wild''*

### Studies in support

Cats were the main predator of reintroduced, predator-inexperienced, hare-wallabies in two locations (Gibson et al. 1994; Hardman & Moro 2006; Hardman et al. 2016). Cats can hunt locally-born wallabies (Paltridge et al. 1997). Hare-wallabies were last confirmed in south-west Australia 58 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Lundie-Jenkins et al. (1993) found no spatial correlation one year, and a positive correlation another year, between cats and hare-wallabies. Cats breached the enclosures of two semi-captive hare-wallaby colonies, none were hunted in 5-8 weeks (from Moseby et al. 2015). Hare-wallabies were last confirmed in the Tanami Desert 106 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between cats and rufous hare-wallaby population. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations. In contradiction with the claim, the two species co-occurred for over half-a-century in one locale and for over a century in another.
