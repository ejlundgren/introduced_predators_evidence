IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **A threat**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by Red Foxes (moderate to minor): there is no direct evidence of significant predation on this species by Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes). Predation of similar-sized Pseudomys elsewhere is not significant at the population level."*

</center>

### Studies in support

New holland mice were found in <1% of fox scats  (Mitchell & Banks 2005; Pascoe et al. 2012).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

No studies were found linking foxes to New Holland mouse population trends.

![**Evidence linking *Pseudomys novaehollandiae* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Pseudomys novaehollandiae* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Pseudomys novaehollandiae, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Pseudomys novaehollandiae.png)
