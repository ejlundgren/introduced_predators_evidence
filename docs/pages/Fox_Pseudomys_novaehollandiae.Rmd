IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **A threat**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by red foxes (moderate to minor): there is no direct evidence of significant predation on this species by red fox (vulpes vulpes). Predation of similar-sized pseudomys elsewhere is not significant at the population level."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Foxes hunt mice (Mitchell & Banks 2005; Pascoe et al. 2012).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to New Holland mouse populations.

![**Evidence linking *Pseudomys novaehollandiae* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Pseudomys novaehollandiae* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Pseudomys novaehollandiae, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Pseudomys novaehollandiae.png)
