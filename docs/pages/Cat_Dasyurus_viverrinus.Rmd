IUCN status: **Endangered**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by introduced feral cats and red foxes are the most likely causes."*

### Studies in support

There is evidence of cat predation of eatern quolls (Peacock & Abbott 2014)

### Studies not in support

Fancourt et al. (2015) found no evidence of a negative correlation between quoll and cat abundance. Cats were not among predators of reintroduced quolls (Peacock & Abbott 2014; Robinson et al. 2020; Robinson et al. 2021). Quolls were last confirmed in NSW 148 years after cats arrived and continue to co-occurr on Tasmania after two centuries (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to tiger quoll populations. In contradiction with the claim, the two species co-occurred on the mainland for over a century and continue to co-occur in Tasmania after more than two centuries.

![**Evidence linking *Dasyurus viverrinus* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasyurus viverrinus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Dasyurus viverrinus*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008. Small points show unconfirmed records (excluded from analyses). See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Dasyurus viverrinus.png)
