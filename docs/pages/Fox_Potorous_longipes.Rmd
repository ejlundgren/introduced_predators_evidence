<center>
IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN claim: *"Major threats to the species include predation from foxes"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Long-footed potoroos were reported at lower occupancy when fox density was above zero (Robley et al. 2022). Potoroos were also dound in foxes’ diet (Davis et al. 2015).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

Foxes were found to be correlated negatively with long-footed potoroos in a single unpublished study which did not test for confounding variables.

![**Evidence linking *Potorous longipes* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Potorous longipes* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Potorous longipes, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Potorous longipes.png)
