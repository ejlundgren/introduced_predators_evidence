IUCN status: **Endangered**

EPBC Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by feral cats may also be a threat."*

### Studies in support

Stobo-Wilson et al. (2020a) reported lower quoll occupancy correlated with higher cat occupancy across Melville Island and north of Northern Territory mainland (Stobo-Wilson et al. 2020a). Palmer et al. (2021) reported a positive association between poison-baiting targeting cats and quoll abundance, but no effect of poison-baiting on cats was found, nor direct association between cats and quolls tested. Cats hunt quolls (Pollock 1999; Oakwood 2000; Peacock & Abbott 2014; Stokeld et al. 2018; Cowan et al. 2020).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

Cats are among a range of ecological variables negatively correlated with quoll abundance, but causality cannot be inferred due to confounding variables..

![**Evidence linking *Dasyurus hallucatus* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasyurus hallucatus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Dasyurus hallucatus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Dasyurus hallucatus.png)
