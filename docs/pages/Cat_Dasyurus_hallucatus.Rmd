EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by feral cats may also be a threat."*

### Studies in support

Stobo-Wilson et al. (2020) reported lower quoll occupancy correlated with higher cat occupancy across Melville Island and north of Northern Territory mainland. Palmer et al. (2021) reported a positive association between poison-baiting targeting cats and quoll abundance, but no effect of poison-baiting on cats was found, nor direct association between cats and quolls tested. Cats hunt quolls (Pollock 1999; Oakwood 2000; Peacock & Abbott 2014; Stokeld et al. 2018; Cowan et al. 2020).

### Studies not in support

Palmer et al. (2021) reported a positive temporal correlation between northern quoll detections and poison baiting, but no correlation with cats. Analysing relationships between cats, quolls and vegetation in the tropical savanna, Trewella et al. (2023) concluded that the two species can co-occurr in structurally complex habitat. Woinarski et al. (2011) documented the presence and absence of quolls and cats across the Sir Edward Pellew island group: the quolls were present on one of the islands on which cats occurred.

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

Some studies suggest that cats are among a range of ecological variables negatively correlated with quoll abundance, while other studies suggest that the two species can co-occur.

![**Evidence linking *Dasyurus hallucatus* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasyurus hallucatus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Dasyurus hallucatus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Dasyurus hallucatus.png)
