IUCN Status: **Endangered**

EPBC Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN Claim: *'Predation by feral cats may also be a threat.''*

### Studies in support

Stobo-Wilson et al. (2020a) reported lower quoll occupancy correlated with higher cat occupancy across Melville Island and north of Northern Territory mainland (Stobo-Wilson et al. 2020a). Palmer et al. (2021) reported a positive association between poison baiting targeting cats and quoll abundance, but no effect of poison baiting on cats was found, nor direct association between cats and quolls tested. Cats hunt quolls (Pollock 1999; Oakwood 2000; Peacock & Abbott 2014; Stokeld et al. 2018; Cowan et al. 2020).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

Cats are among a range of ecological variables negatively correlated with quoll abundance, but causality cannot be inferred due to confounding variables..

![**Fig. 1**  Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasyurus hallucatus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of threatened mammals, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Dasyurus hallucatus.png)
