IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **N/A**

IUCN Claim: *' Predation by red foxes and possibly feral cats has led to a past decline of mainland populations.''*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats hunt quokkas (Hayward et al. 2005; Bain 2015).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to quokka populations.

![**Fig. 1**  Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Setonix brachyurus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of threatened mammals, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Setonix brachyurus.png)
