IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Not assessed**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by red foxes and possibly feral cats has led to a past decline of mainland populations."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats hunt quokkas (Hayward et al. 2005; Bain 2015).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to quokka population trends.

![**Evidence linking *Setonix brachyurus* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Setonix brachyurus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Setonix brachyurus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Setonix brachyurus.png)
