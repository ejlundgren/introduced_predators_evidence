### Studies in support

Broad-faced potoroos were last confirmed in Perth, WA 31 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Broad-faced potoroos were last confirmed in Norseman, WA one year before cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of broad-faced potoroos. In contradiction with the claim, the extinction record from Norseman pre-dates the cat arrival record.
