### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Broad-faced potoroos were last confirmed in WA (two records) 15 years before, to 45 years after, cats arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

No studies were found evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of broad-faced potoroos. It cannot be verrified that extinction occurred after cat arrival.
