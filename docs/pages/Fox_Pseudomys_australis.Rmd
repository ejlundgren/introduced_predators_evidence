IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN claim: *"Recent research has demonstrated marked detrimental impact of introduced predators: Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and feral Domestic Cats (Felis catus)"*

### Studies in support

Plains rats were more common inside a predator-proof fenced area compared to outside (Moseby et al. 2020), as was also observed by Read & Cunningham (2010). Plains rats remains were found in the foxes' diet (Pavey et al. 2008; Pavey et al. 2014). Rats were last confirmed in Koonchera Dune, SA, 21-26 years after foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Rats were last confirmed in Mootwingee National Park, NSW, 70-40 years before foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

Absence of predators was associated with higher plains rat abundance is supportive of the hypothesis but data comes from a single study site, and thus possibly confounded. In one region the extirpation record pre-dates the fox arrival record.

![**Evidence linking *Pseudomys australis* to foxes.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Pseudomys australis* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of *Pseudomys australis*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes. Error bars show minimum and maximum extinction intervals. Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019. Small points show unconfirmed records (excluded from analyses). See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Pseudomys australis.png)
