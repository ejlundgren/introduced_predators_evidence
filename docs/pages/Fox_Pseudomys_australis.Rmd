IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN Claim: *' Recent research has demonstrated marked detrimental impact of introduced predators: Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and feral Domestic Cats (Felis catus)''*

</center>

### Studies in support

Plains rats remains were found in the foxes' diet (Pavey et al. 2008; Pavey et al. 2014). Read & Cunningham (2010) described an occasion where more plains rats were captured inside than outside a fenced reserve where carnivores were excluded. Rats were last confirmed at Koonchera Dune, SA, 24 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Rats were last confirmed in NSW 63 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between foxes and plains rats which report data. In contradiction with the claim, NSW extirpation record pre-dates fox arrival record.
