IUCN status: **Critically Endangered**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Very high/Extreme**

IUCN claim: *"Translocation experiments in the past and other data demonstrate that Red Foxes and feral Cats are major threats"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats hunted 6 of 68 reintroduced possums (Clarke 2011).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

No studies were found linking cats to Western ringtail possum population trends.

![**Evidence linking *Pseudocheirus occidentalis* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Pseudocheirus occidentalis* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Pseudocheirus occidentalis, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Pseudocheirus occidentalis.png)
