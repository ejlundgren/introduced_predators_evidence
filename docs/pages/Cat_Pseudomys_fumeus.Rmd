IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN claim: *"The species is significantly preyed upon by introduced Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes), wild dogs (Canis lupus dingo), and feral Domestic Cats (Felis catus)."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats hunt smoky mice (Cockburn 1981).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

No studies were found linking cats to smoky mouse population trends.

![**Evidence linking *Pseudomys fumeus* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Pseudomys fumeus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Pseudomys fumeus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Pseudomys fumeus.png)
