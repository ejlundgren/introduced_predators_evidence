### Studies in support

Lesser stick-nest rats were last confirmed in SA 16 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Lesser stick-nest rats were last confirmed in the NT, NSW and Victoria 17-36 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and the extinction of lesser stick-nest rats. In contradiction with the claim, most extinction records pre-date the fox arrival record.
