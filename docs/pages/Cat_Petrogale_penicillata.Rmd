### Studies in support

Cats possibly hunt rock-wallabies (Doherty et al. 2015).

![**Evidence linking *Petrogale penicillata* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Petrogale penicillata* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Petrogale penicillata, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Petrogale penicillata.png)
