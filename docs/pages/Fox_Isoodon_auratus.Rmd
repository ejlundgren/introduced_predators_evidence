IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **N/A**

IUCN Claim: *'The reasons for past declines of the Golden Bandicoot are predation by feral cats and red foxes''*

</center>

### Studies in support

Bandicoots were last confirmed in the Nullarbor 10 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Foxes were not among predators of reintroduced bandicoots (Christensen & Burrows 1995). Bandicoots were last confirmed in NSW 46 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to golden bandicoots. In contradiction with the claim, the extirpation records from NSW predates the fox arrival record.
