IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **N/A**

IUCN Claim: *'Forest fragmentation combined with predation from foxes appear to be the principal reasons for the decline of the species. Grazing and burning regimes that affect availability of shelter are a disadvantage to populations (Maxwell et al. 1996). Reintroductions of the species have been unsuccessful due to fox predation.''*

### Studies in support

Found in 1% of fox scats in one site (Glen et al. 2011). In one study, foxes hunted 12 of 12 reintroduced, predator-inexperienced, wallabies (Short et al. 1992).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between  foxes and parma wallaby populations. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations.
