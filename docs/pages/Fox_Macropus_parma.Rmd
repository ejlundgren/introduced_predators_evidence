IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Not assessed**

IUCN claim: *"Forest fragmentation combined with predation from foxes appear to be the principal reasons for the decline of the species. Grazing and burning regimes that affect availability of shelter are a disadvantage to populations (Maxwell et al. 1996). Reintroductions of the species have been unsuccessful due to fox predation."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Found in 1% of fox scats in one site (Glen et al. 2011). In one study, foxes hunted 12 of 12 reintroduced, predator-inexperienced, wallabies (Short et al. 1992).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between  foxes and parma wallaby populations. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations.

![**Evidence linking *Macropus parma* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Macropus parma* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Macropus parma, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Macropus parma.png)
