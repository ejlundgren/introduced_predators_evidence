### Studies in support

Crescent nail-tail wallabies were last confirmed in WA 43-99 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Crescent nail-tail wallabies were last confirmed in NSW 18 years before cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of crescent nail-tail wallabies. In contradiction with the claim, the extinction records from NSW pre-dates the cat arrival record, and the two species co-occured in WA for over half-a-century.
