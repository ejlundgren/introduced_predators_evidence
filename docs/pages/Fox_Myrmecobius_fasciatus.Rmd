IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high/Extreme**

IUCN Claim: *The introduction of the predatory Red Fox and feral cats has had a profound impact and continues to be a major threat today (Friend 2008).'*

</center>

### Studies in support

A poison baiting campaign initiated in 1982 was followed by a population increase (Friend 1990) until 1992 (Friend & Thomas 1994), after which the population crashed (Friend & Page 2017).

### Studies not in support

Foxes were not the main cause of mortality nor the main predator of reintroduced numbats (Friend & Thomas 1994). Numbats were last confirmed in NSW 3 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between numbats and foxes. Poison baiting is not a reliable proxy for fox abundance. In contradiction with the claim, the extirpation record pre-dates the fox arrival record.
