IUCN status: **Extinct**

Last seen: *Leporillus apicalis were last seen in 1933 in Norman Tindale, near Mt Crombie, south of the Musgrave Ranges in north-western South Australia (IUCN 2023)*

IUCN claim: *"Predation by feral cats is considered the main cause of extinction. The arrival of Red Foxes in range may have driven remnant subpopulations to extinction"*

</center>


### Studies in support

Lesser stick-nest rats were last confirmed in Norman Tindale, the Western Division of NSW, southern NT (three records) and Euston 43-53, 3-53, 5-27, and 7-17 years after cats arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Lesser stick-nest rats were last confirmed in northwest Victoria 4 years before, to 17 years after, cats arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of lesser stick-nest rats. In one region it cannot be verified that extirpation occurred after cat arrival.
