IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN Claim: *'The major threat for L. conditor is predation by feral cats and red foxes.''*

### Studies in support

Cats were among predators of reintroduced captive-bred stick-nest rats (Copley 1999). Stick-nest rats were last confirmed in the Nullarbor, Murray-Darling, Flinders Ranges, and NSW 5-53 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Stick-nest rats were last confirmed in NSW 18 years before cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to stick-nest rat populations. In contradiction with the claim, the NSW extipration record pre-dates the cat arrival record, and in one locale the two species co-occurred for over half-a-century.
