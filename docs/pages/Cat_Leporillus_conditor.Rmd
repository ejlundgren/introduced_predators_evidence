IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN claim: *"The major threat for l. conditor is predation by feral cats and red foxes."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats were among predators of reintroduced captive-bred stick-nest rats (Copley 1999). Stick-nest rats were last confirmed in the Nullarbor, Murray-Darling, Flinders Ranges, and NSW 5-53 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Stick-nest rats were last confirmed in NSW 18 years before cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to stick-nest rat populations. In contradiction with the claim, the NSW extipration record pre-dates the cat arrival record, and in one locale the two species co-occurred for over half-a-century.

![**Evidence linking *Leporillus conditor* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Leporillus conditor* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Leporillus conditor*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Leporillus conditor.png)
