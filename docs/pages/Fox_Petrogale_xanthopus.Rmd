IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: ****

IUCN claim: *"Predation from introduced foxes is the greatest threat to Yellow-footed Rock Wallabies (Lapidge and Henshall 2001)."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Stobo-Wilson et al. (2020b) reported that rock-wallabies were detected at 2 intensively poison-baited sites where foxes were not detected, and the wallabies were not detected at 2 control sites where foxes were detected, but no statistical analysis was provided. Lethbridge & Alexander (2008) reported that in South Australia, growth rates of rock-wallaby colonies increased where poison-baiting was intensified, and remained stable at control sites. Sharp et al. (2014) reported that at two sites in NSW and SA, intensification of poison-baiting for 3 years was associated with increased rock-wallaby abundance, while wallaby population remained stable at control sites, and that juveniles were more common at one high-intensity poisoning site. Rock-wallaby has been found in foxesâ€™ diet (Hornsby 1997; Lapidge & Henshall 2001). Copley (1983) described that in the Gawler Ranges, rock-wallabies declined after the arrival and population growth of foxes but no data was provided.

### Studies not in support

Copley (1983) described that in the Flinders Ranges, rock-wallabies declined before the arrival of the fox but no data was provided.

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between foxes and yellow-footed that randomised treatment and control sites, and accounted for confounding variables.

![**Evidence linking *Petrogale xanthopus* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Petrogale xanthopus* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Petrogale xanthopus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.
