### Studies in support

Lesser bilbies were last confirmed 24 and 50 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and the extinction of lesser bilbies. The two species co-occurred for half-a-century in one locale.
