IUCN status: **Extinct**

Last seen: *Macrotis leucura were last seen in 1967 in Alice Springs near the edge of the Simpson Desert (IUCN 2023)*

IUCN claim: *"Predation from introduced feral cats and red foxes is considered to be the major cause of extinction, probably exacerbated by changes in fire regime."*

### Studies in support

Lesser bilbies were last confirmed 24 and 50 years after foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and the extinction of lesser bilbies. The two species co-occurred for half a century in one locale.
