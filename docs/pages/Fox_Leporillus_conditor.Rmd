IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN claim: *"The major threat for L. conditor is predation by feral cats and red foxes."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Foxes were among predators of reintroduced captive-bred stick-nest rats (Copley 1999). Stick-nest rats were last confirmed in the Nullarbor 18-26 years after foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Stick-nest rats were last confirmed in the Murray-Darling, Flinders Ranges, and NSW 23-46 years before foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to stick-nest rat population trends. In contradiction with the claim, most extirpation records pre-date fox arrival records.

![**Evidence linking *Leporillus conditor* to foxes.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Leporillus conditor* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of *Leporillus conditor*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Leporillus conditor.png)
