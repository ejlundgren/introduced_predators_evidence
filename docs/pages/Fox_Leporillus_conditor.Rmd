IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN Claim: *'The major threat for L. conditor is predation by feral cats and red foxes.''*

### Studies in support

Foxes were among predators of reintroduced captive-bred stick-nest rats (Copley 1999). Stick-nest rats were last confirmed in the Nullarbor 18-26 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Stick-nest rats were last confirmed in the Murray-Darling, Flinders Ranges, and NSW 23-46 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to stick-nest rat populations. In contradiction with the claim, most extipration records pre-date fox arrival records.

![**Fig. 1** Evidence linking *Leporillus conditor* to foxes. **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Leporillus conditor* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of Leporillus conditor, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Small points show unconfirmed records (excluded from analyses). Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019 *Biol. Invasions*](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Leporillus conditor.png)
