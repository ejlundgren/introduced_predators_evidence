IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN Claim: *'The major threat for L. conditor is predation by feral cats and red foxes.''*

### Studies in support

Foxes were among predators of reintroduced captive-bred stick-nest rats (Copley 1999). Stick-nest rats were last confirmed in the Nullarbor 18-26 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Stick-nest rats were last confirmed in the Murray-Darling, Flinders Ranges, and NSW 23-46 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to stick-nest rat populations. In contradiction with the claim, most extipration records pre-date fox arrival records.
