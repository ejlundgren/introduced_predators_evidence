IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN Claim: *'The species presumably was extirpated from mainland Australia by a combination ofÂ predation by the Red Fox and feral cat and habitat disturbance.''*

</center>

### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Hare-wallabies were last confirmed on the mainland in Western Australia 17-20 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to banded hare-wallabies. In contradiction with the claim, the exirpation record pre-dates the fox arrival record.
