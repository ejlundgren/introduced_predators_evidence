IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Not assessed**

IUCN claim: *"The species presumably was extirpated from mainland Australia by a combination ofÂ predation by the Red Fox and feral cat and habitat disturbance."*

</center>

### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Hare-wallabies were last confirmed on the mainland in southwest Australia (two records) 1.5-32.5 years before foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to banded hare-wallabies. The exirpation records pre-date the fox arrival records.

![**Evidence linking *Lagostrophus fasciatus* to foxes.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Lagostrophus fasciatus* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of *Lagostrophus fasciatus*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Lagostrophus fasciatus.png)
