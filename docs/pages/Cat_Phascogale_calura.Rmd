IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN Claim: *'Predation by feral cats is considered to be a severe threat over the species' entire range, but has not been quantified. Predation by the Red Fox is considered a minor threat because of the arboreal behaviour of phascogales.''*

</center>

### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Phascogales were last confirmed in NSW 18 years before cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to red-tailed phascogales. In contradiction with the claim the extipration record pre-dates the cat arrival record.
