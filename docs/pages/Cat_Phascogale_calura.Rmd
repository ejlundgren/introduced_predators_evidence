IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by feral cats is considered to be a severe threat over the species' entire range, but has not been quantified. Predation by the Red Fox is considered a minor threat because of the arboreal behaviour of phascogales."*

### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Phascogales were last confirmed in NSW 18 years before cats arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to red-tailed phascogales. In contradiction with the claim the extipration record pre-dates the cat arrival record.

![**Evidence linking *Phascogale calura* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Phascogale calura* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Phascogale calura*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Phascogale calura.png)
