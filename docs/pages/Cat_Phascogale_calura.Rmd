IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN Claim: *'Predation by feral cats is considered to be a severe threat over the species' entire range, but has not been quantified. Predation by the Red Fox is considered a minor threat because of the arboreal behaviour of phascogales.''*

### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Phascogales were last confirmed in NSW 18 years before cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to red-tailed phascogales. In contradiction with the claim the extipration record pre-dates the cat arrival record.

![**Fig. 1** Evidence linking *Phascogale calura* to cats. *A.* Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Phascogale calura* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of threatened mammals, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. *B.* Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats . Error bars show record uncertainty range. Small points show unconfirmed records (excluded from analyses). Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008 *Conservation Science Western Australia*](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Phascogale calura.png)
