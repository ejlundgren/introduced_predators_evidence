### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Woinarski et al. (2011) documented the presence and absence of phascogales and cats across the Sir Edward Pellew island group: the phascogales were present on one of the islands on which cats occurred.

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

No studies were found linking cats to northern brush-tailed phascogale.

![**Evidence linking *Phascogale pirata* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Phascogale pirata* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Phascogale pirata, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Phascogale pirata.png)
