### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Big-eared hopping mice were last confirmed one year before cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of big-eared hopping mice. In contradiction with the claim, the extinction record pre-dates the cat arrival record.
