IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN Claim: *'The species is threatened by introduced predators, the Red Fox and feral Cat especially''*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats hunt them (Horsup & Evans 1993; Fisher 1999; Fisher et al. 2001; Augusteyn et al. 2022). Wallabies were last confirmed in NSW 25 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

No correlation was found between cat and wallaby abundance (Augusteyn et al. 2022). No evidence was found that killing cats promotes wallaby abundance (Augusteyn et al. 2022). Cats were not among predators of reintroduced, predator-inexperienced wallabies (Hayward et al. 2012).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to nail-tail wallaby populations.
