IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN claim: *"The reasons for past declines of the Golden Bandicoot are predation by feral cats and red foxes"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats were the main predator of a group of reintroduced, predator-inexperienced bandicoots (Blythman et al. 2020) and also on locally-born bandicoots (Wysong 2016; Doherty et al. 2017). Bandicoots were last confirmed in the Nullarbor and the Canning Stock Route 22-52 and 40-51 years after cats arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Cats were not recorded as predators of a group of reintroduced bandicoots (Christensen & Burrows 1995). A cat breached a bandicoot enclosure, none were hunted in five weeks (from Moseby et al. 2015). Bandicoots were last confirmed in western NSW (two records) 23 years before, to 30 years after, cats arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

No studies were found linking cats to golden bandicoot population trends. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations. In one region it cannot be verified that extirpation occurred after cat arrival.

![**Evidence linking *Isoodon auratus* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Isoodon auratus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Isoodon auratus*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show minimum and maximum extinction intervals. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Isoodon auratus.png)
