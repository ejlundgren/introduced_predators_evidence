IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN Claim: *'The reasons for past declines of the Golden Bandicoot are predation by feral cats and red foxes''*

### Studies in support

Cats were the main predator of a group of reintroduced, predator-inexperienced bandicoots (Blythman et al. 2020). Cats also predated on another reintroduced group (Christensen & Burrows 1995) and on locally-born bandicoots (Wysong 2016; Doherty et al. 2017). Bandicoots were last confirmed in the Nullarbor 37 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Cat breached fence of semi-captive bandicoot enclosure, none were hunted in 5 weeks (from Moseby et al. 2015). Bandicoots were last confirmed in NSW 18 years before cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to golden bandicoot populations. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations. In contradiction with the claim the extirpation record from NSW pre-dates the cat arrival record.
