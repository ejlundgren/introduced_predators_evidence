IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by introduced foxes"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Wallaby remains were found in 1% of fox scats (Pascoe et al. 2012)and were found in another study (Sinclair 2020).

### Studies not in support

Wallaby remains were not found in fox scats where wallabies were common (Lunney et al. 1996).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to brush-tailed rock-wallaby populations.

![**Evidence linking *Petrogale penicillata* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Petrogale penicillata* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Petrogale penicillata, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Petrogale penicillata.png)
