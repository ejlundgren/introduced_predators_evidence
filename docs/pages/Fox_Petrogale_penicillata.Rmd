IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN Claim: *' Predation by introduced foxes''*

</center>

### Studies in support

Wallaby remains were found in 1% of fox scats (Pascoe et al. 2012)and were found in another study (Sinclair 2020).

### Studies not in support

Wallaby remains were not found in fox scats where wallabies were common (Lunney et al. 1996).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to brush-tailed rock-wallaby populations.

![**Fig. 1**  Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Petrogale penicillata* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of Petrogale penicillata, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Petrogale penicillata.png)
