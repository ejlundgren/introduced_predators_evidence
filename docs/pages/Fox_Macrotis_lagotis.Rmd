IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Extreme**

IUCN claim: *"The major threat to the Bilby is predation by introduced red foxes and feral cats"*

### Studies in support

About 70% of bilby extirpation records (36 populations) occurred 1-53 years after foxes arrived and the timing of fox establishment correlates with bilby extirpation across the country (Abbott 2001). Fox probability of occurrence was a negative predictor of bilby occurrence, but model uncertainty was high (Southgate et al. 2007). Bilbies reintroduced inside fenced reserves (excluding foxes, cats and dingoes) have improved survival rates (Moseby et al. 2011).

### Studies not in support

Sixteen bilby populations (~30% of records) were last recorded 0-13 years before foxes arrived (Abbott 2001). Bilbies were last recorded in the Murray-Darling about 20 years before fox arrival (Copley 1999). In one study foxes were not among the predators of reintroduced bilbies (Lohr et al. 2021).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

The evidence for a negative association between foxes and bilby populations is inconclusive due to high model uncertainty. A temporal correlation between extirpation and arrival does not prove causation particularly since nearly a third pre-date fox arrival and confounding variables were not tested for.

![**Evidence linking *Macrotis lagotis* to foxes.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Macrotis lagotis* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of *Macrotis lagotis*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes. Error bars show minimum and maximum extinction intervals. Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019.
