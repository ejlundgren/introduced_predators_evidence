IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN claim: *"The current major threats to the natural populations of the species include: the accidental introduction of predators (introduced cats and foxes)"*

### Studies in support

Cats were the main predator, or a predator, of predator-inexperienced (where known) reintroduced bettongs (Christensen & Burrows 1995; Short & Turner 2000; Moseby et al. 2011; Moseby et al. 2018; Moyses et al. 2020). Cats hunted bettongs in fenced reserve (Moseby et al. 2019). Bettongs were last confirmed in NSW, QLD and Victoria 17-40 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. In Submission).

### Studies not in support

A positive correlation was found between cat and bettong abundance within a fenced reserve, despite evidence of hunting, and bettong recruitment was confirmed (Moseby et al. 2019). A cat breached the fence of a semi-captive bettong enclosure, yet none were hunted in 1 month (from Moseby et al. 2015). Bettongs were last confirmed in Western Australia a century after cats arrived (Wallach et al. In Submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between cats and burrowing bettong populations. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a proxy for the fate of locally-born populations. In contradiction with the claim, the two species co-occurred for decades and up to a century in some regions.

![**Evidence linking *Bettongia lesueur* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Bettongia lesueur* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Bettongia lesueur*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008. Small points show unconfirmed records (excluded from analyses).](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Bettongia lesueur.png)
