### Studies in support

Long-tailed hopping mice were last confirmed in WA and NT 2 and 27 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Long-tailed hopping mice were last confirmed in NSW 30 years before cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of long-tailed hopping mice. In contradiction with the claim, the extinction record from NSW pre-dates the cat arrival record.
