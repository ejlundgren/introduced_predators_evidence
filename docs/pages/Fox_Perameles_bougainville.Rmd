IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN claim: *"The current major threats to the natural subpopulations of the species include: the accidental introduction of predators (introduced cats and foxes)"*

### Studies in support

Bandicoots were reintroduced successfully into a fenced reserve which excluded foxes (Richards & Short 2003). Richards (2012) argued that the incursion of foxes into a fenced reserve led to population declines, but no data was provided. Bandicoots were last confirmed in the Nullarbor, WA and SA 14-26 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al 202X).

### Studies not in support

Bandicoots were last confirmed in NSW and south-west WA 20-46 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. In Submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between foxes and western barred bandicoot populations. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations. In contradiction with the claim, two extirpation records pre-date the fox arrival records.

![**Evidence linking *Perameles bougainville* to foxes.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Perameles bougainville* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of *Perameles bougainville*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Perameles bougainville.png)
