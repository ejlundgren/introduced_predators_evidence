IUCN status: **Extinct**

Last seen: *Pseudomys glaucus were last seen in 1956 in ‘between Burren and Walgett’ in northern New South Wales (IUCN 2023)*

IUCN claim: *"Extinction is considered to have been due to habitat clearance and predation by feral cats. Predation by red foxes may have contributed."*

### Studies in support

Blue-gray mice were last confirmed in NSW 49 years after foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Blue-gray mice were last confirmed in QLD 26 years before foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and the extinction of blue-gray mice. In contradiction with the claim, the extinction record from QLD pre-dates the fox arrival record.
