### Studies in support

Blue-gray mice were last confirmed in NSW 49 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Blue-gray mice were last confirmed in QLD 26 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and the extinction of blue-gray mice. In contradiction with the claim, the extinction record from QLD pre-dates the fox arrival record.
