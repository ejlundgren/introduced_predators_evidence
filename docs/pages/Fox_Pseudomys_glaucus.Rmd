IUCN status: **Extinct**

Last seen: *Pseudomys glaucus were last seen in 1956 between Burren and Walgett, northern NSW (IUCN 2023)*

IUCN claim: *"Extinction is considered to have been due to habitat clearance and predation by feral cats. Predation by red foxes may have contributed."*

</center>


### Studies in support

Blue-gray mice were last confirmed and in north NSW 46-51 years after foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Blue-gray mice were last confirmed in the region of southeast QLD and northeast NSW 39 years before, to 46 years after, foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

No studies were found evidencing a link between foxes and the extinction of blue-gray mice. In one region it cannot be verified that extirpation occurred after fox arrival.
