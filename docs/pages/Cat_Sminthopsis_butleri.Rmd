IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Not assessed**

IUCN claim: *"Exotic predators (cats and possibly dogs)"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Carpentarian dunnarts were among small mammals negatively correlated with cat occupancy (Stobo-Wilson et al. 2020a)

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

Cats have been documented among a range of ecological variables negatively correlated with Carpentarian dunnarts in one study. Causality for decline cannot be inferred due to confounding variables.

![**Evidence linking *Sminthopsis butleri* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Sminthopsis butleri* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Sminthopsis butleri, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Sminthopsis butleri.png)
