EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **High/Very High**

IUCN claim: *"The major reason for past decline has been predation by Red Foxes and feral cats"*

### Studies in support

The number of bounties paid for Bettongia spp. declined around the same time that fox bounties increased in New South Wales, but it is not known whether bounties reflect abundance and which species were hunted (Short 1998). Foxes predated on reintroduced woylies (Marlow et al. 2015). Woylies were detected in a single fox scat among 450 scats analysed from four sites where woylies occurred (Marlow et al. 2014). One study reported higher bettong abundance at poison-baited sites compared to controls but fox abundance was not monitored and sites were not randomly selected (Wayne et al. 2011). Woylies were last confirmed in the Nullarbor 18-33 years after foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Studies by Kinnear et al. (2002), Orell (2004), Marlow et al. (2015), Yeatman et al. (2016), and Wayne et al. (2017) reported that woylies initially increased after poison-baiting intensification but the population eventually crashed. Wayne et al. (2017) documented that woylies declined and fox abundance increased but no evidence of a correlation was provided (Wayne et al. 2017). Another study reported that increased poison-baiting intensity was positively associated with woylie abundance, however the trend overlapped with zero, foxes were not monitored, and there were no control sites without poisoning (Geary et al. 2023). Foxes were not listed among predators of reintroduced woylies (Priddel & Wheeler 2004, Martin et al. 2006). Woylies were last confirmed in the Murray River and Goodooga 38-33 and 23-18 years before foxes arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

No studies were found evidencing a negative association between foxes and woylie populations. Bounties are not a reliable proxy of abundance (particularly when the species is unidentified); the fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations; and poison-baiting is not a reliable proxy of fox abundance. In two regions, woylie extirpation records pre-date fox arrival records

![**Evidence linking *Bettongia penicillata* to foxes.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Bettongia penicillata* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of *Bettongia penicillata*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes. Error bars show minimum and maximum extinction intervals. Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019. Small points show unconfirmed records (excluded from analyses). See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Bettongia penicillata.png)
