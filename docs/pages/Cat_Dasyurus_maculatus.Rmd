### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Cat abundance increased in 2 of 4 sites or years while quoll abundance did not change, nor was there evidence of cat predation on quolls (Körtner et al. 2003).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to tiger quolls.

![ Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasyurus maculatus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Dasyurus maculatus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Dasyurus maculatus.png)
