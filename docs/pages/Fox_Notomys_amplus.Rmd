### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Short-tailed hopping mice were last confirmed 17 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and the extinction of short-tailed hopping mice. In contradiction with the claim, the extinction record pre-dates the fox arrival record.
