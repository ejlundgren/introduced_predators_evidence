IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Not assessed**

IUCN claim: *" Predation by Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes; moderate, entire range)"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Nalliah et al. (2022) reported a negative correlation between mice and foxes associated with fire and vegetation conditions. Heath mouse remains were found in foxes’ diet (Davis et al. 2015; Sinclair 2020).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

Foxes have been documented among a range of ecological variables negatively correlated with heath mouse abundance but cause of extirpation remains unknown.

![**Evidence linking *Pseudomys shortridgei* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Pseudomys shortridgei* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Pseudomys shortridgei, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Pseudomys shortridgei.png)
