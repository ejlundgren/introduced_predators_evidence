### Studies in support

Foxes or another canid (Canis sp.) were the main predators of a group of captive-raised reintroduced quolls (Robinson et al. 2020; Robinson et al. 2021). Historical records suggest foxes hunted or scavenged quolls when quolls were abundant (Peacock & Abbott 2014). Quolls were last confirmed in NSW 54 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to eastern quoll populations.
