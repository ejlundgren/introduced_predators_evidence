### Studies in support

Foxes or another canid (Canis sp.) were the main predators of a group of captive-raised reintroduced quolls (Robinson et al. 2020; Robinson et al. 2021). Historical records suggest foxes hunted or scavenged quolls when quolls were abundant (Peacock & Abbott 2014). Quolls were last confirmed in NSW 54 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to eastern quoll populations.

![Evidence linking *Dasyurus viverrinus* to foxes. **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasyurus viverrinus* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of *Dasyurus viverrinus*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019. Small points show unconfirmed records (excluded from analyses).](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Dasyurus viverrinus.png)
