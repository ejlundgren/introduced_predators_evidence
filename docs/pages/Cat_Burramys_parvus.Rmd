IUCN status: **Critically Endangered**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN claim: *"The population at Mt. Buller suffers from fragmentation and subpopulations here and around ski resorts in the Kosciuszko area have declined severely since 2000 due to: habitat destruction, predation by feral cats, and possibly low snow cover. "*

</center>

### Studies in support

Possums were found in cat’s diet (Doherty et al. 2015).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to pygmy possum populations.

![**Evidence linking *Burramys parvus* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Burramys parvus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Burramys parvus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Burramys parvus.png)
