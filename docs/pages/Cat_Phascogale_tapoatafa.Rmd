IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN Claim: *"The greatest current threat is predation by feral cats'"*

### Studies in support

Cats hunted captive-bred reintroduced phascogales (Soderquist & Serena 1994).

### Studies not in support

Phascogale remained at low abundance as cat abundance declined, but no statistical analysis, control, or other variables were tested for (Wayne et al. 2017).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to brush-tailed phascogale populations.

![ Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Phascogale tapoatafa* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Phascogale tapoatafa, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Phascogale tapoatafa.png)
