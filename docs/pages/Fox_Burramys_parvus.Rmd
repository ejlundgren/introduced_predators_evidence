IUCN Status: **Critically Endangered**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN Claim: *'Predation by the introduced Red Fox is also a threat''*

</center>

### Studies in support

Possums were found in fox scats in three studies (Green & Osborne 1981; Green 2003; Davis et al. 2015).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to pygmy possum populations.

![**Fig. 1**  Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Burramys parvus* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of threatened mammals, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Burramys parvus.png)
