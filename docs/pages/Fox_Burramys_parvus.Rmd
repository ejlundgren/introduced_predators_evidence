IUCN status: **Critically Endangered**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by the introduced Red Fox is also a threat"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Possums were found in fox scats in three studies (Green & Osborne 1981; Green 2003; Davis et al. 2015).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to pygmy possum populations.

![**Evidence linking *Burramys parvus* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Burramys parvus* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Burramys parvus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Burramys parvus.png)
