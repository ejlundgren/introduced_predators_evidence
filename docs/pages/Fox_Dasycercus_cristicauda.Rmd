IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN Claim: *"Threats are poorly understood but include predation by and competition with feral cats and Red Foxes,'"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Mulgara were found in foxes’ diet (Mahon 1999; Paltridge 2002; Cupples et al. 2011); and mulgara were last confirmed in the Nullarbor 16 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Mulgara were last confirmed in NSW 4 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between foxes and mulgara populations. In contradiction with the claim, the extirpation record from NSW pre-dates the fox arrival record.

![**Evidence linking *Dasycercus cristicauda* to foxes.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasycercus cristicauda* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of *Dasycercus cristicauda*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Dasycercus cristicauda.png)
