IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN Claim: *Threats are poorly understood but include predation by and competition with feral cats and Red Foxes,'*

</center>

### Studies in support

Mulgara were found in foxes’ diet (Mahon 1999; Paltridge 2002; Cupples et al. 2011); and mulgara were last confirmed in the Nullarbor 16 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Mulgara were last confirmed in NSW 4 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between foxes and mulgara populations. In contradiction with the claim, the extirpation record from NSW pre-dates the fox arrival record.
