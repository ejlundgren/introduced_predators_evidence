IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Moderate**

IUCN Claim: *'Another threat is predation by feral cats (moderate, mainland part of range), which has not been demonstrated, but is highly plausible on the mainland; however, this is somewhat ameliorated by the rugged nature of habitat, which offers some protection from cats, and by partially arboreal behaviour.''*
