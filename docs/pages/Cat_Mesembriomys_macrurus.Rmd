IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Not assessed**

IUCN claim: *"Another threat is predation by feral cats (moderate, mainland part of range), which has not been demonstrated, but is highly plausible on the mainland; however, this is somewhat ameliorated by the rugged nature of habitat, which offers some protection from cats, and by partially arboreal behaviour."*

![**Evidence linking *Mesembriomys macrurus* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Mesembriomys macrurus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Mesembriomys macrurus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Mesembriomys macrurus.png)
