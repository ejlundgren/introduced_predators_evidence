IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN Claim: *'Predation by foxes and dogs''*

</center>

### Studies in support

A fox consumed part of a quoll, possibly scavenged (Körtner et al. 2003).

### Studies not in support

Körtner et al. (2003) found no effect of poison baiting on quoll abundance and no effect on fox abundance in 3 of 4 sites or years.

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to tiger quoll populations.

![**Fig. 1**  Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasyurus maculatus* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of Dasyurus maculatus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Dasyurus maculatus.png)
