IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by foxes and dogs"*

</center>

### Studies in support

A fox consumed part of a quoll, possibly scavenged (Körtner et al. 2003).

### Studies not in support

Körtner et al. (2003) found no effect of poison-baiting on quoll abundance and no effect on fox abundance in 3 of 4 sites or years.

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to tiger quoll populations.

![**Evidence linking *Dasyurus maculatus* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasyurus maculatus* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Dasyurus maculatus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Dasyurus maculatus.png)
