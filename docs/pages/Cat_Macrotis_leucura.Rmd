IUCN status: **Extinct**

Last seen: *Macrotis leucura was last seen near Koonchera Dune (Cooncherie) in north-eastern South Australia in 1931 and in 1967 in Alice Springs near the edge of the Simpson Desert (IUCN 2023)*

IUCN claim: *"Predation from introduced feral cats and red foxes is considered to be the major cause of extinction, probably exacerbated by changes in fire regime."*

### Studies in support

Lesser bilbies were last confirmed at Koonchera Dune and Alice Springs 51-61 and 87-97 years after cats arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

No studies were found evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of lesser bilbies.
