IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Not assessed**

IUCN claim: *"Across its range, the Platypus is also subject to predation by the introduced Red Fox, dogs and cats."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Platypus were found in fox scats (Brown 1990; Green 2003; Purcell 2008; Davis et al. 2015).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to platypus populations.

![**Evidence linking *Ornithorhynchus anatinus* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Ornithorhynchus anatinus* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Ornithorhynchus anatinus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Ornithorhynchus anatinus.png)
