IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **N/A**

IUCN Claim: *'Across its range, the Platypus is also subject to predation by the introduced Red Fox, dogs and cats.''*

</center>

### Studies in support

Platypus were found in fox scats (Brown 1990; Green 2003; Purcell 2008; Davis et al. 2015).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to platypus populations.

![**Fig. 1**  Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Ornithorhynchus anatinus* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of Ornithorhynchus anatinus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Ornithorhynchus anatinus.png)
