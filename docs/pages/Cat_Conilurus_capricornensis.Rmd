### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Capricorn rabbit rats were last confirmed 75 years before cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of Capricorn rabbit rats. In contradiction with the claim, the extinction record pre-dates the cat arrival record.
