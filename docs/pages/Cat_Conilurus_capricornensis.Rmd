IUCN status: **Extinct**

Last seen: *Conilurus capricornensis were last seen in 1787 in Rockhampton and Townsville regions, QLD (IUCN 2023)*

IUCN claim: *"This species has never been recorded alive, so assessment of threats is speculative. It was probably affected by the same threats that contributed to the extinction of Conilurus albipes - most likely predation by feral cats"*

</center>


### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Capricorn rabbit rats were last confirmed 75 years before cats arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of Capricorn rabbit rats. In contradiction with the claim, the extinction record pre-dates the cat arrival record.
