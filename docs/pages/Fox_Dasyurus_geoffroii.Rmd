### Studies in support

Quoll population increased after poison-baiting was intensified, but no evidence provided the baiting impacted foxes (Morris et al. 2003). Quoll abundance was higher at poison-baited sites compared to controls, though not at statistical significance, fox abundance was not monitored, and sites not selected randomly (Wayne et al. 2011). Quoll population increased and then declined where poison-baiting was conducted, and at one site it was observed but not evidenced that the population increased (Orell 2004; DEC 2012). A translocation failed at a site not intensively poison-baited, and a quoll sighting occurred where poison-baiting was intensive (Kinnear et al. 2002). poison-baiting targeting cats was associated with a decline in foxes, but temporal association with quoll abundance wasn’t analysed and association between fox and quoll abundance was unclear (Comer et al. 2020). Quolls were last confirmed 7 and 26 years after foxes arrived in the Eyre Peninsula and Nullarbor, respectively (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Increased poison-baiting intensity relative to quoll abundance overlapped with zero, and no data on foxes, nor control sites without poisoning were included (Geary et al. 2023). Foxes were not among predators of translocated quolls (Moseby et al. 2015; Moseby et al. 2021a; Moseby et al. 2021b). Quoll abundance increased and fox abundance also increased but no statistical analysis, control, or other variables were tested for (Wayne et al. 2017). Quolls were last confirmed in NSW 46 years before foxes arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between foxes and western quoll populations. Poison-baiting is not a reliable proxy of fox abundance. In contradiction with the claim, the extirpation record from NSW pre-dates the fox arrival record.

![**Evidence linking *Dasyurus geoffroii* to foxes.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasyurus geoffroii* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of *Dasyurus geoffroii*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019.
