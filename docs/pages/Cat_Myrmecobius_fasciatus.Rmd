IUCN status: **Endangered**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN claim: *"The introduction of the predatory Red Fox and feral cats has had a profound impact and continues to be a major threat today (Friend 2008)."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats were among predators of reintroduced numbats (Friend & Thomas 1994). Numbats were last confirmed in NSW 25 years after cats arrived (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to numbat population trends.

![**Evidence linking *Myrmecobius fasciatus* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Myrmecobius fasciatus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Myrmecobius fasciatus*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Myrmecobius fasciatus.png)
