IUCN status: **Critically Endangered**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **High/Very High**

IUCN claim: *"The major reason for past decline has been predation by Red Foxes and feral cats"*

### Studies in support

Cats commonly predate on reintroduced woylies (James et al. 2002; Priddel & Wheeler 2004; Martin et al. 2006; Wheeler & Priddel 2009; Marlow et al. 2015a). Woylies were last recorded in the Murray River, Goodooga, and the Nullarbor 7-17, 22-32, and 48-68 years after cats arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

No correlation was suggested nor tested between woylie and cat abundance (Wayne et al. 2017). Several woylie deaths were attributed to cat predation, but after killing a single cat (described “large”), predation ceased despite other cats remaining in the area (from Moseby et al. 2015).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between cats and woylie populations. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations.

![**Evidence linking *Bettongia penicillata* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Bettongia penicillata* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Bettongia penicillata*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show minimum and maximum extinction intervals. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008. Small points show unconfirmed records (excluded from analyses). See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Bettongia penicillata.png)
