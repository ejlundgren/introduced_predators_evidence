IUCN Status: **Critically Endangered**

EPBC Threat Rating: **High/Very High**

IUCN Claim: *'The major reason for past decline has been predation by Red Foxes and feral cats''*

### Studies in support

Cats commonly predate on reintroduced woylies (James et al. 2002; Priddel & Wheeler 2004; Martin et al. 2006; Wheeler & Priddel 2009; Marlow et al. 2015a). Woylies were last recorded in NSW 7-27 years after cats arrived and in the Nullarbor 53 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

No correlation was suggested nor tested between woylie and cat abundance (Wayne et al. 2017). Several woylie deaths were attributed to cat predation, but after killing a single cat (described “large”), predation ceased despite other cats remaining in the area (from Moseby et al. 2015).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between cats and woylie populations. The fate of reintroduced animals is not a reliable proxy for the fate of populations.
