### Studies in support

Blue-gray mice were last confirmed in QLD 55 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Blue-gray mice were last confirmed in NSW 115 years after cats arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of blue-gray mice. In contradiction with the claim, the two species co-occurred for over half-a-century in QLD and over a century in NSW.
