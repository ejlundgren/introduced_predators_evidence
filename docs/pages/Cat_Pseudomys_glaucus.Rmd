IUCN status: **Extinct**

Last seen: *Pseudomys glaucus were last seen in 1956 between Burren and Walgett, northern NSW (IUCN 2023)*

IUCN claim: *"Extinction is considered to have been due to habitat clearance and predation by feral cats. Predation by red foxes may have contributed."*

</center>


### Studies in support

Blue-gray mice were last confirmed in the region of southeast QLD and northeast NSW and in north NSW 41-126 and 106-126 years after cats arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

No studies were found evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of blue-gray mice. The two species co-occurred for over a century before extinction.
