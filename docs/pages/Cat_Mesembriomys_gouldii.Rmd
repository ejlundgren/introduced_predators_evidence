IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by feral cats may also be a threat."*

### Studies in support

Cats hunt tree-rats (Stokeld et al. 2018). Lower tree-rat occupancy was correlated with higher cat occupancy across Melville Island and north of Northern Territory mainland (Stobo-Wilson et al. 2020a).

### Studies not in support

No relationship between cat detection and tree-rat detection on Melville Island (Davies et al. 2018).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

Cats have been documented among a range of ecological variables negatively correlated with black-footed tree rats in one study but not in the other. Causality cannot be inferred due to confounding variables.

![**Evidence linking *Mesembriomys gouldii* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Mesembriomys gouldii* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Mesembriomys gouldii, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Mesembriomys gouldii.png)
