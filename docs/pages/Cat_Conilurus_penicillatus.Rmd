IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **High/Very High**

IUCN claim: *"Predation by feral cats is a likely major threat"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Lower rat site occupancy was associated with higher cat detection on Melville Island (Davies et al. 2017; Davies et al. 2018; Penton et al. 2021) and higher cat occupancy across Melville Island and north of Northern Territory mainland (Stobo-Wilson et al. 2020a)

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

Cats are among a range of ecological variables negatively correlated with rat abundance, but causality cannot be inferred due to confounding variables.

![**Evidence linking *Conilurus penicillatus* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Conilurus penicillatus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Conilurus penicillatus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Conilurus penicillatus.png)
