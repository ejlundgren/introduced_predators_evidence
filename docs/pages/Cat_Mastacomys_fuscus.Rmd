IUCN status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN claim: *"The species is threatened by predation from introduced foxes (Vulpes vulpes) (Bubela and Happold 1993, Green 2002) and Domestic Cats (Felis catus) (L. Broome pers. comm., Milner et al. 2015)."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats hunt broad-toothed mice (Doherty et al. 2015).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking cats to broad-toothed mouse population trends.

![**Evidence linking *Mastacomys fuscus* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Mastacomys fuscus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Mastacomys fuscus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Mastacomys fuscus.png)
