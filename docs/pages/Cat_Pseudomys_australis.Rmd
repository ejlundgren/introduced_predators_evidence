IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **Very high**

IUCN claim: *"Recent research has demonstrated marked detrimental impact of introduced predators: Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and feral Domestic Cats (Felis catus)"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Cats hunt rats (Pavey et al. 2008; Pavey et al. 2014). Read & Cunningham (2010) described an occasion where more plains rats were captured inside than outside a fenced reserve where carnivores were excluded (no data or analysis was provided). Rats were last confirmed at Koonchera Dune, SA, 56 years after cats arrived (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Rats were last confirmed in NSW 35 years before cats arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between cats and plains rats that report data. In contradiction with the claim, the NSW extirpation record pre-dates cat arrival record, and the two species co-occurred at one locale for over half a century.

![**Evidence linking *Pseudomys australis* to cats.** **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Pseudomys australis* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Pseudomys australis*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008. Small points show unconfirmed records (excluded from analyses). See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Pseudomys australis.png)
