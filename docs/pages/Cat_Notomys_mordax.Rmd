### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Darling Downs hopping mice were last confirmed the same year cats arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of Darling Downs hopping mice. In contradiction with the claim, the extinction record does not follow the cat arrival record.
