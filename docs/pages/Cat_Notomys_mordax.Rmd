### Studies in support

No studies

### Studies not in support

Darling Downs hopping mice were last confirmed 10 years before, to 9 years after, cats arrived (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of Darling Downs hopping mice. It cannot be verified that extinction occurred after cat arrival.
