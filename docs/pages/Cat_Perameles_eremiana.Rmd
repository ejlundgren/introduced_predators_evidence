### Studies in support

Crescent nail-tail wallabies were last confirmed 58 years after cats arrived (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between cats and the extinction of desert bandicoots. In contradiction with the claim, the two species co-occured for over half-a-century.
