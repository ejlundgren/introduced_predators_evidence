IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Extreme**

IUCN Claim: *On the mainland, predation by introduced feral Cat and Red Foxes was the major cause of extinction in the wild'*

### Studies in support

The tracks of a fox were detected for the first time around the time signs of a local wallaby population disappeared (Lundie-Jenkins et al. 1993). Hare-wallaby was found in a fox scat (Lundie-Jenkins et al. 1993). Hare-wallabies were last confirmed in the Tanami Desert 63 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Foxes were not among predators of reintroduced hare-wallabies (Gibson et al. 1994). Hare-wallabies were last confirmed in south-west Australia 30 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between foxes and rufous hare-wallaby population that has been tested statistically. In contradiction with the claim, the extirpation record from south-west Australia pre-dates the fox arrival record, and the the two species co-occurred in one locale for over half-a-century.
