IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Extreme**

IUCN Claim: *'On the mainland, predation by introduced feral Cat and Red Foxes was the major cause of extinction in the wild''*

### Studies in support

The tracks of a fox were detected for the first time around the time signs of a local wallaby population disappeared (Lundie-Jenkins et al. 1993). Hare-wallaby was found in a fox scat (Lundie-Jenkins et al. 1993). Hare-wallabies were last confirmed in the Tanami Desert 63 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Foxes were not among predators of reintroduced hare-wallabies (Gibson et al. 1994). Hare-wallabies were last confirmed in south-west Australia 30 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between foxes and rufous hare-wallaby population that has been tested statistically. In contradiction with the claim, the extirpation record from south-west Australia pre-dates the fox arrival record, and the the two species co-occurred in one locale for over half-a-century.

![**Fig. 1** Evidence linking *Lagorchestes hirsutus* to foxes. *A.* Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Lagorchestes hirsutus* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of threatened mammals, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. *B.* Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of foxes . Error bars show record uncertainty range. Small points show unconfirmed records (excluded from analyses). Predator arrival records were digitized from Fairfax 2019 *Biol. Invasions*](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Lagorchestes hirsutus.png)
