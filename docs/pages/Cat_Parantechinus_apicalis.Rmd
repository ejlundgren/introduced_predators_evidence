IUCN status: **Endangered**

EPBC Predator Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN claim: *"Introduced foxes and cats are known to prey on this species"*

### Studies in support

Cats hunt dibblers (Friend 2003).

### Studies not in support

![**Evidence linking *Parantechinus apicalis* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Parantechinus apicalis* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Parantechinus apicalis, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. See methods section in [current submission] for details on evidence categories.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Parantechinus apicalis.png)
