IUCN Status: **Critically Endangered**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high/Extreme**

IUCN Claim: *'Translocation experiments in the past and other data demonstrate that Red Foxes and feral Cats are major threats''*

### Studies in support

Foxes hunt locally-born possums (Jones et al. 1994; Grimm & De Tores 2009) and they hunted 9 of 68 reintroduced possums (Clarke 2011).

### Studies not in support

Decades of poison-baiting aimed at foxes did not prevent population decline (Wayne et al. 2017).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to Western ringtail possum populations.

![**Fig. 1**  Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Pseudocheirus occidentalis* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that foxes contribute to the decline of threatened mammals, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Pseudocheirus occidentalis.png)
