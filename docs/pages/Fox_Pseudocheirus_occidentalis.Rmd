IUCN status: **Critically Endangered**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Very high/Extreme**

IUCN claim: *"Translocation experiments in the past and other data demonstrate that Red Foxes and feral Cats are major threats"*

</center>

### Studies in support

Foxes hunt locally-born possums (Jones et al. 1994; Grimm & De Tores 2009) and they hunted 9 of 68 reintroduced possums (Clarke 2011).

### Studies not in support

Decades of poison-baiting aimed at foxes did not prevent population decline (Wayne et al. 2017).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies linking foxes to Western ringtail possum populations.

![**Evidence linking *Pseudocheirus occidentalis* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Pseudocheirus occidentalis* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Pseudocheirus occidentalis, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Pseudocheirus occidentalis.png)
