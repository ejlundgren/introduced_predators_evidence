![**Evidence linking *Sminthopsis douglasi* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Sminthopsis douglasi* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Sminthopsis douglasi, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Sminthopsis douglasi.png)
