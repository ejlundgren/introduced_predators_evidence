IUCN Status: **Near Threatened**

EPBC Threat Rating: **High**

IUCN Claim: *"N/A'"*

### Studies in support

Rock wallaby remains were found in the cat’s diet (Doherty et al. 2015).

### Studies not in support

Rock-wallaby remains were not found in the cat’s diet (Lapidge & Henshall 2001). Stobo-Wilson et al. (2020b) reported that rock-wallabies were detected at 2 sites but not at the other 2 sites, and that cats were detected at all 4, but no statistical analysis was provided.

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between cats and yellow-footed rock-wallaby populations.

![**Evidence linking *Petrogale xanthopus* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Petrogale xanthopus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Petrogale xanthopus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Petrogale xanthopus.png)
