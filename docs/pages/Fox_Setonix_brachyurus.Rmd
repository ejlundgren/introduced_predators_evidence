IUCN status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **Not assessed**

IUCN claim: *" Predation by red foxes and possibly feral cats has led to a past decline of mainland populations. Fox control has led to an increase in numbers in some areas."*

</center>

### Studies in support

Foxes hunt quokkas (Hayward et al. 2005; Sinclair & Hyder 2009). Hayward et al. (2007) associated quokka presence with higher poison-baiting intensity. Hayward (2002) described a spatial correlation between quokka extirpation and fox establishment, but no analysis was provided.

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between  foxes and quokka populations that include data analysis. Poison-baiting is not a reliable proxy of fox abundance.

![**Evidence linking *Setonix brachyurus* to foxes.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Setonix brachyurus* and foxes. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *foxes* contribute to the decline of Setonix brachyurus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Fox_Setonix brachyurus.png)
