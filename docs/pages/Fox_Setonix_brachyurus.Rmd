IUCN Status: **Vulnerable**

EPBC Threat Rating: **N/A**

IUCN Claim: *' Predation by red foxes and possibly feral cats has led to a past decline of mainland populations. Fox control has led to an increase in numbers in some areas.''*

</center>

### Studies in support

Foxes hunt quokkas (Hayward et al. 2005; Sinclair & Hyder 2009). Hayward et al. (2007) associated quokka presence with higher poison-baiting intensity. Hayward (2002) described a spatial correlation between quokka extirpation and fox establishment, but no analysis was provided.

### Studies not in support

No studies

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between  foxes and quokka populations that include data analysis. Poison-baiting is not a reliable proxy of fox abundance.
