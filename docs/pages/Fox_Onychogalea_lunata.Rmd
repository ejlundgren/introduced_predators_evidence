### Studies in support

Crescent nail-tail wallabies were last confirmed in WA 15-31 years after foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Crescent nail-tail wallabies were last confirmed in south-west WA and NSW 18 and 47 years before foxes arrived (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and the extinction of crescent nail-tail wallabies. In contradiction with the claim, the extinction records from south-west WA and NSW pre-date the fox arrival record.
