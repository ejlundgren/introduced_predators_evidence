IUCN status: **Extinct**

Last seen: *Onychogalea lunata were last seen in 1952 (1950-1954) in Wheatbelt, WA (IUCN 2023)*

IUCN claim: *"This species was probably extirpated by predation from introduced foxes and cats."*

</center>


### Studies in support

Crescent nail-tail wallabies were last confirmed in the Wheatbelt (two records) and Nullarbor 10-39 and 7-23 years after foxes arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Crescent nail-tail wallabies were last confirmed in western NSW (two records) and southwest WA 53-20 and 27-2 years before foxes arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

No studies were found evidencing a link between foxes and the extinction of crescent nail-tail wallabies. In two regions the extirpation records pre-date the fox arrival records.
