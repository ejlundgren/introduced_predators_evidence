IUCN status: **Extinct**

Last seen: *Onychogalea lunata were last seen in 1952 (1950-1954) in Wheatbelt, WA (IUCN 2023)*

IUCN claim: *"This species was probably extirpated by predation from introduced foxes and cats."*

### Studies in support

Crescent nail-tail wallabies were last confirmed in the Wheatbelt and Nullarbor 17.5-41.5 and 4.5-25.5 years after foxes arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Studies not in support

Crescent nail-tail wallabies were last confirmed in western NSW (two records) 55.5-17.5 years before foxes arrived, and in the Wheatbelt (a second record) and southwest WA 83.5 and 29.5 years before, to 27.5 and 0.5 years after, foxes arrived, respectively (Current submission).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a link between foxes and the extinction of crescent nail-tail wallabies. In one region the extirpation record pre-dates the fox arrival record, and in two regions it cannot be verified that extirpation occurred after fox arrival.
