![**Evidence linking *Hipposideros inornatus* to cats.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Hipposideros inornatus* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that *cats* contribute to the decline of Hipposideros inornatus, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Hipposideros inornatus.png)
