### Studies in support

Cats hunted quolls translocated to the Flinders Ranges, SA (Moseby et al. 2015; Moseby et al. 2021a; Moseby et al. 2021b). Cats also hunt locally-born quolls (Glen et al. 2010). Detection rate of quolls was higher after poison-baiting targeting cats, in four monitoring periods, but measures of cat abundance differed by method and association between cat and quoll abundance was unclear (Comer et al. 2020). Quoll abundance increased while cat abundance declined, but no statistical analysis, control, or other variables were tested for (Wayne et al. 2017). Quolls were last confirmed 53 and 65 years after cats arrived in the Nullarbor and Eyre Peninsula, respectively (Wallach et al. 202X).

### Studies not in support

Intensive poison-baiting was associated with reduced cat abundance and reduced quoll abundance over time (Moseby et al. 2021a).

### Is the threat claim evidence-based?

There are no studies evidencing a negative association between cats and western quoll populations that has been tested statistically. Poison-baiting is not a reliable proxy of cat abundance.

![Evidence linking *Dasyurus geoffroii* to cats. **A.** Systematic review of evidence for an association between *Dasyurus geoffroii* and cats. Positive studies are in support of the hypothesis that cats contribute to the decline of *Dasyurus geoffroii*, negative studies are not in support. Predation studies include studies documenting hunting or scavenging; baiting studies are associations between poison baiting and threatened mammal abundance where information on predator abundance is not provided; population studies are associations between threatened mammal and predator abundance. **B.** Last records of extirpated populations relative to earliest local records of cats. Error bars show record uncertainty range. Predator arrival records were digitized from Abbott 2008.](assets/figures/Main_Evidence_Cat_Dasyurus geoffroii.png)
